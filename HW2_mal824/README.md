#HW 2 Source Citations and Explanations

### Assignment 1 & 2 

For this assignment, I followed Shay Lehmann's code and work since I am still getting up to speed on my Python coding skills. I was able to import the MTA data from my API key and use JSON to read and parse the data. I was able to filter through the various column headers of the data stream to find the bus stop names, bus stop location (longitude and latitude), and distance from stop. I was also able to append any data that was not present using N/A. 

### Assignment 3

For this assignment, I worked on my own to append a data file of all but two numeric columns and plot a graph of the social media usage for NYC government agencies.  The two numerical columns I graphed were social media usage/hits (y-axis) over time (x-axis). I have included all code I referenced from external sources in the body of the assignment.  Please see the HW2_mal824 Jupyter notebook within my CUSP directory for the full assignment and graph rendering.
