### 4.a
My understanding to the idea of Lopa's experiment is to test
Users with age under 35 bike longer than all users' average bike duration.

So Null Hypothesis of Lopa's experiment which is users with age under 35 bike
less or same as all users' bike duration in average. And I agree with Lopa's 
Null Hypothesis

Lopa's Alternate Hypothesis, which is users with age under 35 bike more than all
users' bike duration in average, is complementary with the Null Hypothesis.  And
I agree with Lopa's Alternate Hypothesis

Therefore, Lopa's Null Hypothesis and Alternate Hypothesis are valid.

### 4.b
the data Lopa used to support his Hypothesis Testing are the "tripduration" and 
"birth year" which extracted from the original data set.  Lopa used "birth year" as independent variable and "tripduration" as dependent variable to visualize the data.  However, since Lopa is trying to compare the average trip duration of users above age 35 and the average trip duration of whole users, I 
think Lopa should calculate the two means and to test.  Lopa only plotted the whole scatter view of 'birth year' respects to 'tripduration' that does not give the plot for the two means of two groups: Users with Age under 35 and All users.

### 4.c
From the code I can see Lopa was tring to find the mean trip duration 
of Users above age 35 and plot it.  For this test, I suggest she can use
t-Test to Test her hypothesis.   The reason to choose t-Test is because we are 
looking at differences between two groups on average trip durations, where two groups here are users with age above 35 and all users, and only have two groups for statistical test.
